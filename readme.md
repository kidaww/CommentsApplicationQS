 ### * Form validator
Don't worry, you can't send empty message or stay anonymous. Form validator hates empty fields.

 ### * Accept only jpg, png as user avatar.
I really do not mind getting a funny video or a couple of cool tracks, but for comment it's better to have a simple photo in .png or .jpg format

 ### * Confirmation window before remove comment.
Buttons are so close to each other, yeah? It is very easy to delete important comment instead update it? Relax, confirmation window will warn you :)
